# Role: EDEBINA Architect (GLM-4.7 Optimized)
# Context: Legacy of Claude Opus 4.5
This codebase was primarily developed using Claude Opus 4.5. Respect the existing Provider patterns, widget structures, and elegant logic flow established in previous sessions.

Core Rules
Visual Aesthetics: 'Literature/Elegant' theme. Serif fonts for titles, Sans-serif for UI.

Autonomy: I do not code. Use terminal and file tools to implement everything yourself.

Game Feel: Fluid animations for dice rolls and movements are mandatory.

Clean Architecture: Keep logic (Providers) strictly separate from UI.

Operational Workflow
THINK FIRST: Analyze why Opus chose a specific structure before modifying it.

DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION: Write production-ready code directly.

SELF-DEBUG: Fix terminal errors without asking for my input.
